# A HTML5 Report for JGiven

Uses the power of AngularJS, Foundation, and Font Awesome

## Advantages compared to the static HTML report
* It requires less space, because only a single JSONP file has to be generated that is used as input instead of many HTML files for each tag and class
* It is dynamic ;-), so expect that there will be additional features in the HTML5 report that are not available in the static one

## Currently missing features compared to the static HTML report (TODO)

1. Group Tags and Classes are not collapsed in the Navigation menu
1. Cases are not collapsed
1. Expand/Collapse All Button
1. Search in scenarios
1. Extended Description for steps should be nicer

## Planned features that are not present in the static HTML report

1. Filtering by multiple tags instead of only one tag
